## How to add a new section

To add a new section in the charter, you can do a pull request on the github. Once merged, it will be automatically added on the tutors platform.

The title of the file will be the title of the section. **Do not** add spaces in the name but write underscores instead (e.g.: She_Loves_To_Code).

Please only add .md files. Other files will not be added.
