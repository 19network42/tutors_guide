### What's the difference between Tutors andÂ *Supervising Tutors*?

There is none (Did you get the joke?).

Supervising Tutors are just tutors who oversee and ensure that everything runs smoothly without other tutors needing to worry about it.

They are also kind of "*spokespersons*" of the tutors for the bocal. If you have something to suggest or things you want to do, don't hesitate to contact them. Although, it doesn't mean you can't go to the bocal directly, but it's always better to annoy supervising tutors before them :)
