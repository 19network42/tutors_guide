### What are Tutors

Tutors are students who **"help"** manage the school, organize exams, and coordinate various educational events at 19.

They help with:
- Exams
- Sprints
- She Loves To Code (SLTC)
- etc.

### The general organisation of Tutors

Tutors are managed by *Supervising Tutors*.

### What's the difference between Tutors and *Supervising Tutors*?

There is none (Did you get the joke?).

Supervising Tutors are just tutors who oversee and ensure that everything runs smoothly without other tutors needing to worry about it.

They are also kind of "*spokespersons*" of the tutors for the bocal. If you have something to suggest or things you want to do, don't hesitate to contact them. Although, it doesn't mean you can't go to the bocal directly, but it's always better to annoy supervising tutors before them :)

### How to become a Tutor?

Anyone can become a tutor. You can contact a supervising tutor or attend a kick-off session when one is organized.

### How to leave the Tutors?

You are free to leave whenever you like. All you have to do is leave the Slack channel. If you leave the tutors, it's not definitive. You can join the tutors again as many times as you like.

### What is your goal as a Tutor?

This is a **volunteer** thing and you do as you wish, as you want, when you want.

As a tutor, you are the "fuel" of the school. Without enough tutors, it will be really complicated.

We really encourage you to take initiative in proposing events and things if you want to organize one.

You will be heard, whether it is doable or not.

Some examples of possible things:
- Treasure Hunt
- Monkey-Type
- The Game (this one is a big one, not gonna lie)
- AMA (Ask Me Anything) with Pisciners
- Debugging sessions

Be aware that if not enough people are available for your event (or any event, including exams), the event will be canceled.

### As a tutor, what to do if...

### You want to become a Supervising Tutor?

It's as easy as contacting a Supervising Tutor. Together we will plan a time to talk with you and see what your goal is and why.
